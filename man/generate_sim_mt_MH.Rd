\arguments{
\item{network1}{a biological network}

\item{network2}{a pharmacological network}

\item{network_B}{a bipartite network}

\item{restart}{A real in the range of 0-1, it is the probability to restart the algorithm in the starting point}

\item{tau1}{tau1}

\item{tau2}{tau2}

\item{delta1}{delta}

\item{delta2}{delta}

\item{lambda}{lambda}

\item{layer_transition_1}{cond_jump}

\item{layer_transition_2}{cond_jump}

\item{jump_neighborhood_1}{A boolean, if false, the nodes between omics will be connected if they are the same, if true, the nodes will be connected with itself and its neighborhood but in the other omics}

\item{weighted_multiplex_1}{A boolean, if true, the edge between omics will be weighted. It is considered only if jump_neighborhood is true}

\item{jump_neighborhood_2}{A boolean, if false, the nodes between omics will be connected if they are the same, if true, the nodes will be connected with itself and its neighborhood but in the other omics}

\item{weighted_multiplex_2}{A boolean, if true, the edge between omics will be weighted. It is considered only if jump_neighborhood is true}

\item{aggregation_method}{aggregation method}

\item{get_completeRWRmat}{boolean}

\item{no_seed_nodes}{vector of characterss}

\item{cores}{Number of threads for Parallelization. It has to be positive integer. If it is equal to 1, no parallelization is not performed}
